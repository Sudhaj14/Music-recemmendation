# Music-recemmendation
This project is a Music Recommendation System built using Python and Scikit-learn. It analyzes song data to recommend similar tracks based on user input. By leveraging cosine similarity and the CountVectorizer model, the system compares song attributes like name and artist to generate top 10 song recommendation.
